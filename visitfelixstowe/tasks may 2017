1) Make sure all sites are up to date with the latest widgets, code, templates, site config (Norfolk and Suffolkbiz)

2) Photo Gallery - Phone display needs looking at

3) Lightbox view - make proportionate (quite small when in full size so if this could be bigger)

4) Event Calendar - sort styles

5) Slider on Box Homepage or create a new template called Slider Box homepage

6) Make colour schemes (themes) modula???? (Easy to roll out)

7) Fonts - add Lato, Droid and could we have a bigger font one for people with not much text on pages?

8) Recaptcha - needs sorting.
